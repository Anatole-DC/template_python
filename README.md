To get started, you can [use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=template_python&template_owner=Anatole-DC) from the repository on github. This will create a new repository with this template as base structure.

When the repository will be created, a [cleanup action](.github/workflows/cleanup.yml) will be triggered and will remove all template related name by the new repository informations. The following changes will be applied :
- All the following will be replaced by your repository's name in snake case :
  - The code source directory (currently "python_template")
  - All occurences of `python_template` in the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file and the [.vscode launch configs](.vscode/launch.json).
- The [README subtitle](README.md#L3) and the pyproject.toml will be replaced by your repository description
- All mentions of the author will be replaced by the repository owner's github name
- All github urls will be updated to match the new repository urls

> The cleanup action will be triggered once and then all related files will be deleted (including the action).
> If an error occures during the process, please [report an issue]() for the problem to be fixed as soon as possible.
